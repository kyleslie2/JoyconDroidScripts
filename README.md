# Smash Ultimate training mode scripts
Collection of custom JoyconDroid scripts for improving the training mode in Smash Ultimate

I decided to host a collection of these because I could only find a couple in the wild. Submit a pull request or send me a script if you make one you'd like added.

### Installation requirements
1. Android phone with Bluetooth HID profile (enabled by default in Android 10)
     - The application requires that your device has a Bluetooth HID Profile, which Android Pie (9) is needed for. To verify if your device has the necessary profile, please use the following checker: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdapps.bluetoothhidtester
     - I did some research on using an Android VM instead, and be warned: it is either not possible or very difficult
2. [JoyconDroid app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdapps.gamepad&hl=en_US&gl=US)

## Using these scripts:
- Many of my scripts will be character dependent. They may work universally, but I won't have tested them with other characters' walk/ run speed etc
- Copy or download the scripts in the `scripts` folder and upload them to the TAS UI mode of Joycon Droid
- Edit the text files to your liking to modify the script's behaviour
